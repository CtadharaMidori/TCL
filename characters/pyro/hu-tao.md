**Press**  
Hu Tao consumes a set portion of her HP to knock the surrounding enemies back and enter the **Paramita Papilio** state.

**Paramita Papilio**

* Increases Hu Tao's ATK based on her Max HP at the time of entering this

  state. ATK bonus gained this way cannot exceed 400% of Hu Tao's Base ATK.

* Converts attack DMG to Pyro DMG, which cannot be overridden by any other

  elemental infusion.

* Charged Attacks apply the **Blood Blossom** effect to the enemies hit.
* Increases Hu Tao's resistance to interruption.
* **Paramita Papilio** ends when its duration is over, or Hu Tao has left the battlefield or fallen.

**Blood Blossom**  
Enemies affected by **Blood Blossom** will take Pyro DMG every 4s. This DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG.

Each enemy can be affected by only one **Blood Blossom** effect at a time, and its duration may only be refreshed by Hu Tao herself.
