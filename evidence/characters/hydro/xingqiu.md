## **XQ Q Sword Internal Cooldown**

**Note**: This entry is outdated after further testing and new information about Internal Cooldowns was uncovered. For the most up to date conclusions on Xingqiu's ICDs, see [Xingqiu C6 3rd Wave Applies Hydro Twice](https://github.com/Artesians/TCL/tree/51a02d196d5ac231e4fed8d69b93d3d8111f9891/evidence/characters/hydro/xingqiu/README.md#xingqiu-c6-3rd-wave-applies-hydro-twice)

**Finding:**

Each wave of XQ's swords applies Hydro only once, regardless of how many swords are in that wave.

**Evidence:**

[https://streamable.com/h3wn34](https://streamable.com/h3wn34)

In both of these videos, the sword wave only clears away the existing Pyro on the enemy. If each sword in the wave had a separate ICD, we would expect to see the 1st sword in the wave clear the Pyro, and the second sword would re-apply Hydro so the enemy should have a Hydro aura.

**Significance:**

There are some videos taken before 1.1 where the swords in each wave each seemed to have a separate ICD. This seems to have been fixed as part of the same patch that fixed XQ's orbital swords having a lower ICD after swapping. Let's be careful not to spread those old videos as misinformation.

**Significance:** For vape comps with C6 XQ, every 3rd sword wave basically guarantees hydro aura. For EC comps, it makes it more likely for the electro to be the trigger. Generally speaking, it gives XQ greater hydro aura potential.

## **Xingqiu's Q Damage Calculation is Dynamic**

By: IonFox\#8887

**Theory:**

XQ ult is dynamic and not a snapshot.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/NEnRlMsQRVA](https://youtu.be/NEnRlMsQRVA) \(source : @Ashen Cenpi\)

XQ ult is cast and used against an enemy to determine a baseline.

* NingGuang holding 4 petra creates a hydro crystal and picks it up, granting the team 35% hydro damage.
* Hydro sword damage then observed to increase.

Note: Crystal is picked up after the 2nd wave of swords so hydro res shred from C2 already accounted for.

**Significance:**

XQ ult is dynamic and not a snapshot, buffs/value changes received after casting still affect damage. Previous interaction with dragonslayers is likely a result of the dragonslayers bug currently floating around.

## **Xingqiu E Double Vaporize**

**Finding:**

\_\*\*\_How to vaporize both of Xingqiu’s E slashes with either Gouba or Amber

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03MNwss9UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03MNwss9UI)

There are 2 methods of doing it. You can use Xiangling’s E and time it on Gouba’s attack. The easier method is by using Amber’s ult, you only need to cast E to do it.

**Significance:**

For one-shot \(or two-shot\) compilations, although I’m not sure if this team comp is better since you will lose Barbara’s E buff.

## **Xingqiu’s Rain Sword Damage Reduction does Snapshot**

By: wiremash\#0433

**Finding:**

Xingqiu's Rain Swords Do Snapshot

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/WJUepUXbVmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJUepUXbVmo&feature=youtu.be)

Tested with C2 Barbara and compared the received damage with and without the Hydro buff.

**Significance:**

While Xingqiu's burst Hydro Swords are dynamic, the damage reduction from the Rain Swords is snapshot \(both E and Q\).

**Editor’s Note:**

Verified. Also, a similar instance occurs when using Streaming Essential Oil \(25% Hydro DMG% increase potion\), so we know it's not limited to just Barbara.

## Xingqiu E dash cancel animation

By: Charliex3000\#9403
Added 03/18/2021

**Finding:**

XQ E can be cancelled early by dashing.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/olBKG1I3JEw](https://youtu.be/olBKG1I3JEw)
 
38 frames to dash cancel, 71 frames to ult cancel, 92 frames without a cancel to swap.

**Significance:**

Dash to swap faster since it takes longer to wait for swap than a dash+swap.
