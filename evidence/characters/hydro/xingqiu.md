## **XQ Q Sword Internal Cooldown**

**Finding:**

Each wave of XQ's swords applies Hydro only once, regardless of how many swords are in that wave.

**Evidence:**

[https://streamable.com/h3wn34](https://streamable.com/h3wn34)

In both of these videos, the sword wave only clears away the existing Pyro on the enemy. If each sword in the wave had a separate ICD, we would expect to see the 1st sword in the wave clear the Pyro, and the second sword would re-apply Hydro so the enemy should have a Hydro aura.

**Significance:**

There are some videos taken before 1.1 where the swords in each wave each seemed to have a separate ICD. This seems to have been fixed as part of the same patch that fixed XQ's orbital swords having a lower ICD after swapping. Let's be careful not to spread those old videos as misinformation.

## **Xingqiu's Q Damage Calculation is Dynamic**

By: IonFox\#8887

**Theory:**

XQ ult is dynamic and not a snapshot.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/NEnRlMsQRVA](https://youtu.be/NEnRlMsQRVA) \(source : @Ashen Cenpi\)

XQ ult is cast and used against an enemy to determine a baseline.

* NingGuang holding 4 petra creates a hydro crystal and picks it up, granting the team 35% hydro damage.
* Hydro sword damage then observed to increase.

Note: Crystal is picked up after the 2nd wave of swords so hydro res shred from C2 already accounted for.

**Significance:**

XQ ult is dynamic and not a snapshot, buffs/value changes received after casting still affect damage. Previous interaction with dragonslayers is likely a result of the dragonslayers bug currently floating around.

## **Xingqiu E Double Vaporize**

**Finding:**

\_\*\*\_How to vaporize both of Xingqiu’s E slashes with either Gouba or Amber

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03MNwss9UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03MNwss9UI)

There are 2 methods of doing it. You can use Xiangling’s E and time it on Gouba’s attack. The easier method is by using Amber’s ult, you only need to cast E to do it.

**Significance:**

For one-shot \(or two-shot\) compilations, although I’m not sure if this team comp is better since you will lose Barbara’s E buff.

## **Xingqiu’s Rain Sword Damage Reduction does Snapshot**

**Finding:**

Xingqiu's Rain Swords Do Snapshot

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/WJUepUXbVmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJUepUXbVmo&feature=youtu.be)

Tested with C2 Barbara and compared the received damage with and without the Hydro buff.

**Significance:**

While Xingqiu's burst Hydro Swords are dynamic, the damage reduction from the Rain Swords is snapshot \(both E and Q\).

**Editor’s Note:**

Verified. Also, a similar instance occurs when using Streaming Essential Oil \(25% Hydro DMG% increase potion\), so we know it's not limited to just Barbara.
