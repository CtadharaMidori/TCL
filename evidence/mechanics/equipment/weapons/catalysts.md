## Analysis of whether Xingqiu E/Q counts as a “shield” for Memory of Dust and Bolide

By: ＃＃\#0123

Added 12/7/2020

**Theory**:

For bolide or memory of dust purposes, Xingqiu Q/E are not shields. Beidou C1 and Diona E are.

**Evidence**:

**Significance**

Potential implication for unforged? And you can't get a free shield for memory of dust in your klee/xingqiu team.

## Lost Prayer Stack Mechanics

By: Konbo\#0004

Added 12/7/2020

**Findings**:

Lost Prayer does not reset upon leaving combat, ONLY upon switching to a different character or if the character falls.

Stacks will also continue to build outside of combat as long as the character remains on the field.

**Evidence**:

Switched to a character with Lost Prayer, observed 0% DMG Bonus. Went into combat with a single left click, left combat, observed stacks continuing to build up, observed a 4 stack DMG bonus that remained indefinitely \(tested 5+ minutes afk\) until I switched off.

**Significance**:

Lost Prayer becomes... even better for a main dps while exploring? The fact that you can carry over stacks over multiple fights will help in open world scenarios.

## Catalyst Effective Attack Comparisons

**Findings**

Catalyst effective attack comparisons - see spreadsheet below.

**Evidence**

**Methodology**

Effective attack was calculated with a simple piecewise function that takes into account crit rate, crit damage, attack, and damage % \(elemental damage\). Passives that cannot be quantified due to how they can differ in effectiveness with different playstyles are NOT included in the effective attack calculation.

The spreadsheet has three main columns - for low, medium, and high stats. Each one simulates the every possible substat combination with a total of 10, 20, or 30 offensive lines \(maximum possible rolls is 38, but nobody will ever get such lines - right?\). Royal weapon crit rate is simulated on each possible combination of stats. The base stats used were that of a level 90 Klee using 2 piece Gladiator and 2 piece Witch set.

**Significance**

Memory of dust can actually be strong, even without a shield doubling its effect. Widsith is around ~20% weaker than 5\* catalysts in general outside its burst window, and ~10% stronger during the burst window at R1 and ~30% stronger at R5.
